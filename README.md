# Network Traffic Extraction Using tcpdump

## Overview

This README provides details about the network traffic extraction process that was conducted using `tcpdump`. The traffic emulations were performed in a virtualized environment utilizing Proxmox. Below, we outline the setup of the environment, the roles of various virtual machines (VMs), and the specifics of the traffic captured in the `pcap` files.

## Environment Setup

### Proxmox Virtual Environment

Proxmox is an open-source server virtualization environment that allows the creation and management of virtual machines and containers. In our setup, Proxmox was used to create and manage the virtualized infrastructure necessary for our network traffic emulation.

### Web Server Details

- **IP Address**: 172.19.0.8
- **Server Type**: NGINX
- **Protocol**: HTTP/3
- **Port**: 443

The server hosted on the VM with the IP address `172.19.0.8` serves as an HTTP/3 web server running NGINX. This server was the primary target for the DDoS attacks simulated in our study.

## Network Traffic Emulation

### Normal Traffic Emulation

All IP addresses starting with `172.19...` belong to virtual machines that execute a Python script using the Selenium library. These scripts launch a web client emulator that navigates to the web server, simulating normal background traffic. The objective of this setup is to create realistic web browsing behavior to mix with the attack traffic.

### DDoS Attack Simulation

All IP addresses starting with `172.16...` are assigned to virtual machines designated as bots. These bots are responsible for launching DDoS attacks against the web server at `172.19.0.8`. The attacks are designed to test the resilience and performance of the web server under malicious load.

## Traffic Capture with tcpdump

The network traffic was captured using the `tcpdump` tool. Tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer that allows the capture and analysis of network traffic.

### Example Command

To capture traffic, the following `tcpdump` command was used:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -w traffic_capture.pcap
```

### Python Script for Bidirectional Flow Extraction

In addition to capturing network traffic, we developed a Python script to extract and process each bidirectional flow from the captured `pcap` files. The script considers the following attributes for each flow:

- **Source IP Address**
- **Destination IP Address**
- **Source Port**
- **Destination Port**
- **Protocol**

### Functionality of the Script

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Flow Detection**: It identifies and separates each bidirectional flow based on the source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol.
2. **UDP Datagram Processing**: For each detected bidirectional flow, the script isolates UDP datagrams.
3. **Datagram Encoding**: The isolated UDP datagrams are then stored and encoded for further analysis.



## Feature Extraction

The following features are calculated for each detected bidirectional flow:

| Feature Description | Calculation |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Proportion of each type of QUIC packet (6)** | Ratio between the number of UDP datagrams containing a specific packet type and the total number of UDP datagrams generated by a flow. |
| **Proportion of the size of each QUIC packet (6)** | Ratio of the size (in bytes) of UDP datagrams containing a specific packet type to the total size of all UDP datagrams generated by a flow. |
| **Incoming and outgoing packet size ratio (2)** | Ratio of the total size of incoming and outgoing packets from the server to the total size of all packets in the flow. This indicates the proportion of data transmitted from the server compared to the overall data size. |
| **Average throughput (3)** | Average throughput is calculated by dividing the total data size by the total communication time. This metric is calculated for the incoming, outgoing, and bidirectional flows of the detected agents. |
| **Entropy on QUIC packet type and direction (2)** | Entropy measures the distribution of packets between incoming and outgoing directions for each flow, including the entropy of the types of QUIC packets in each flow. |
| **Packet size variation (3)** | Average size variation between consecutive packets for each agent. This metric is calculated for the incoming, outgoing, and bidirectional flows of the detected agents. |
| **Packet size standard deviation (1)** | Standard deviation of packet sizes for each agent. |
| **Statistics related to IAT (mean, standard deviation, skewness, variance) (12)** | IAT (Inter-Arrival Time) measures the time between consecutive packet arrivals in a data stream. Statistics related to IAT (mean, standard deviation, skewness, variance) are calculated for the incoming, outgoing, and bidirectional flows of each detected agent. |
| **Ratio of the number of QUIC packets in UDP datagrams (2)** | Ratio between UDP datagrams containing a single QUIC packet and all UDP datagrams associated with each detected agent, and the ratio between UDP datagrams containing multiple QUIC packets and all UDP datagrams associated with each detected agent. |
| **Significant time gap in comparison to the total communication time (24)** | Count of time gaps detected between each packet using various thresholds relative to the total time of all packets for each identified agent. This metric is calculated for the incoming, outgoing, and bidirectional flows of the detected agents. |

This detailed extraction and feature computation enable comprehensive analysis of the network traffic, aiding in understanding patterns and identifying anomalies.
